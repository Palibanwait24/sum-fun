The game consists of a 7 x 7 board of tiles and a queue of five tiles.
Each of these tiles is numbered from 0 - 9. In addition, there is a
1-tile border of empty tiles surrounding the board.

The objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board.
This is done by selecting the first tile in the queue and placing it
into an empty spot on the board. If the surrounding tiles add up to
the number on the just-placed tile modulo 10, all are eliminated.
Furthermore, if three or more tiles are eliminated, the player
receives a bonus of 10 * number-of-tiles-removed. Each time a tile is
selected, another tile is added to the bottom of the queue.

In the simplest version of the game, the player has 50 moves to
eliminate all the tiles from the board.

In the more challenging version of the game, the player has an
unlimited number of moves, but only has three minutes to eliminate all
the tiles.
